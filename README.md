# Mission 4

## Description

The task received was to integrate my local MongoDB to the existing car matching API.

The mission has been accomplished in my local server. 

Still to be accomplished: Have a database interface when deployed. I am currently working in a solution for this.

The CLI tool to seed a local MongoDB instance is in this repository, with sample data: https://github.com/TaiAgno/MR-Mission4-tool


SELF-DISCLAIMER

I finally took upon myself the task of cleaning the code and leaving only what is necessary - I feel so much lighter now!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Express
* Node
* Multer
* Axios
* Dotenv
* Cors
* Jest
* Mongoose

### Installing

* npm install express multer axios cors dotenv jest mongoose

### Executing program

* Clone the repository to your local computer
* Clonse this repository to feed your local MongoDB instance with the sample data: https://github.com/TaiAgno/MR-Mission4-tool
* Run the server - npm start
* Open the index.html page on your browser and upload car images to test the API

### Testing

* Unit tests automation disbled for the time being, as the API is still to be linked to the database when deployed. The absence of the database causes the pipeline workflow to crash when tests are present, as they will invariably fail.

### Errors

* To be assessed - ongoing project

## Review
