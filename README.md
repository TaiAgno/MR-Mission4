# Mission 4

## Description

The task received was to integrate my local MongoDB to the existing car matching API.

The mission has been accomplished in my local server.


Still to be accomplished: Have a database interface when deployed. I am currently working in a solution for this.


SELF-DISCLAIMER

I finally took upon myself the task of cleaning the code and leaving only what is necessary - I feel so much lighter now!
